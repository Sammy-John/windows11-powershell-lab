# Windows 11 + PowerShell Lab

A curated set of notes, guides, and cheatsheets as I learn Windows 11 and PowerShell in a virtual lab. Short, actionable pages with copy-paste examples.

---

## Start here
- **Install guide:** Set up a clean Windows 11 lab → [Windows 11 Install](install-guides/windows11-install.md)
- **PowerShell quick ref:** Common object/query patterns → [PowerShell Objects](cheatsheets/powershell-objects.md)

---

## What’s inside
- **Install Guides** – clean installs, snapshots, baselines  
- **Cheatsheets** – quick lookups for commands and syntax  
- **Snippets** – tiny, reusable code blocks (coming soon)

---

## Why I’m doing this
- Build a repeatable **Windows 11 lab** workflow  
- Learn **PowerShell fundamentals** the practical way  
- Create notes I can **share and reuse** quickly
