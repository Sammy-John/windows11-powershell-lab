# 🖥️ Windows Lab Knowledge Base

Welcome! This site is my **personal reference hub** for mastering **Windows OS** and **PowerShell**.  
It grows from hands-on experiments in a virtual machine and evolving notes from daily practice.  

> 💡 The **[Changelog](changelog.md)** is a step-by-step record of my VM lab builds, snapshots, and configuration changes. It’s the running diary of this entire journey.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- 🗂️ Create a **single source of truth** for my Windows and PowerShell knowledge.  
- ⚙️ Capture **repeatable steps** for installs, configuration, and troubleshooting.  
- 📈 Build a **progressive learning path** from fundamentals to real-world workflows.  
- 🕒 Keep a **transparent history** of my lab via the Changelog to track decisions and results.  

---

## 📖 What You’ll Find

- **Guides** – Step-by-step instructions for installs, tools, features, and security tasks.  
- **Notes** – Focused learning notes for Windows 11 features (e.g., Task Scheduler, Services, Event Viewer).  
- **PowerShell** – Hands-on learning notes covering core concepts and administration tasks.  
- **Scripts** – Example general scripts you can adapt for your own systems.  
- **Cheatsheet** – Quick PowerShell syntax and examples to speed up writing scripts.  

!!! tip
    Each section is designed to grow over time — start small, then expand as the lab evolves.

## 📂 Obsidian Vault Integration *(Coming Soon)*

This site will eventually mirror sections from my **Obsidian vault**:

- ✍️ Author and update notes in Obsidian (my daily tool).  
- 🔄 Sync/export them into MkDocs automatically.  
- 🧭 Keep structure consistent so new notes “just appear” in the right section.
